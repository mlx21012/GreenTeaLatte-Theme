# GreenTeaLatte-Theme (Eye Comfortable Theme)
Hi, my name is Xun Jin, this is my first repo in GitHub. 
I made this **Eye Comfortable theme** out of ncecessity, because I know your eyes get tired after hours of coding using Sublime Text 2 which is one of the most popular IDEs out there.

I've been using light green background color for my desktop for years which **I believe** can protect our eyes through long hours of looking at the monitor.
